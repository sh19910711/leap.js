Thankyou for downloading LEAP! Hopefully you'll find it relatively straight-
forward and easy to compile, run and use LEAP. This file should serve
as a good starting point for new comers, and point you in the right
direction.

If you're not happy compiling, you might be interested in the pre-compiled
versions of LEAP for various OS platforms, including Linux, FreeBSD,
Solaris, and Windows.

A new book has been published, which includes a good overview of the
relational algebra, and has a chapter on LEAP. "Theory and Practice of
Relational Databases", 2nd Edition, by Stefan Stanczyk, Bob Champion, and
Richard Leyton, Published by an Taylor & Francis ; ISBN: 0415247020
(Softback), 0415247012 (Hardback).

installed by default (tandp) is taken from the books examples.

LEAP Compilation options
------------------------
LEAP supports the readline libraries if they are installed. The readline
libraries allow command line history and command editing. Versions 2.0 and
2.1 are known to work. 

For more information see Q2.0 in the LEAP FAQ. This is available via the
LEAP website: http://leap.sf.net

Debug output can also be disabled, see Q2.1 in the FAQ for details, but
briefly run configure with '--disable-debug' and recompile.
