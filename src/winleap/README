This directory contains a copy of ALL the files that I have received from
Curt Hill. I'm simply checking them into CVS to make them available to
others.

Curt Hill, the author of WinLEAP, wrote this, back in October 1998:

"As to the source: This is built in C++Builder from Borland.  This is why I
was able to put it together quickly. There is probably less than 500 lines
of code.  However, porting that to their version 4.5 or 5.0 system would be
near impossible, since it uses the VCL and the language extensions that
allow the Rapid App Develement. "
