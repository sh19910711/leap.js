The best place to visit for information about LEAP is the sourceforge
site:

www.sourceforge.net/projects/leap

and select the "Files" option.

LEAP can be downloaded from a large number of FTP sites from around
the world. The main Linux archives of sunsite.unc.edu, and tsx.mit.edu
all hold LEAP in apps/databases and source/usr.bin respectively. 

These sites are mirrored extensively around the world. The most up-to-date
site is a web based site:

http://leap.sourceforge.net/

or via ftp:

ftp://ftp.demon.co.uk/pub/compsci/databases/leap

Closely followed by:

ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/databases/relational
