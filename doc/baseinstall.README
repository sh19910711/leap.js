This file is only of interest to users installing a small footprint, pre-configured
version of LEAP. 

Symbolic links have been created to reduce the amount of disk space
required in your account by LEAP.

You have your own copy of your databases, report directory and
configuration.

Everything else is shared, and read-only.
