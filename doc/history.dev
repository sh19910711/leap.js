Version 1.2.6.1
---------------
* Fixed the long lasting 'leapattributes' problem.

Version 1.2.6
-------------
* Release updated to tie in with book "Theory and Practice of Relational
  Databases", 2nd Edition, by Stefan Stanczyk, Bob Champion and Richard Leyton.
  Published by Taylor & Francis Books Ltd; ISBN: 0415247020 (Softback), 0415247012  
  (Hardback).
* See http://www.theorypractice.org for more information
* Added a new field to a relation mem struct, to manage "last delete" ref.
  this is then referenced by update/insert to reuse space in a relation,
  thereby reducing file size and table scans.
* Default install database stripped down to single database. Date and Korth
  have been moved off into a seperate script: install.date.src and
  install.korth.src
* install.src relates to above book, and page/example id's have been changed
  accordingly.
* Updated documentation.

Version 1.2.5.2
---------------
* Fixed regexp bug
* Modified notify script to reference sourceforge mailing list

Version 1.2.5.1
---------------
* Fixed bug in rl_project - leading spaces in attributes
* Fixed bug in skit_to_alnum - now stops on nulls.
* Fixed AIX error for strchr proto

Version 1.2.5
-------------
* Bug fixes
+ Update operator had problems
+ SEGV in change operator due to incorrect character structure.
* leaprel 'TEMP' attribute maintained in change operator.
* leaprel 'NOATTRIBUTES' attribute maintained.
* leaprel 'UPDATED' attribute maintained.

Version 1.2.4
-------------
* Bug fixes
+ Hashing tables were not being written or read from disk properly
+ Delete/Update operations were not maintaining hash tables
* Minor performance improvements 
* Relation printing scalable, tidier and more informative.
* Newly created databases do not have temporary relations hanging
  around.
* New option --merge-stderr - for Curt Hill's WinLEAP
* Relocated the report on the last operation. The report is now
  displayed when the input stream returns to stdin, and the user
  is expected to type something.

Version 1.2.3
-------------

  expressions), courtesy of Fabrice Lavanant. Uses
  the Henry Spencer regexp implementation. This
  is downloadable from:
  ftp://ftp.cs.toronto.edu/pub/regexp.shar.Z

1.0 - Version 1 release
-----------------------
- Lint changes.

11.02.1997 - Pre-release ready (0.12)
-------------------------------------
Final beta is ready for distribution.
- Many bug fixes
- Delete operator
- New options
- New command line options
- Natural join stable and robust

27.12.1996 - Variables/Status merged (0.12)
-------------------------------------------
Status settings and variables merged.

03.11.1996 - Performance and portability (0.11)
-----------------------------------------------
- Minor performance improvements (Tuples have a new structure, and
  keep files open for writing, rather than repetitive close/open)
- Ultrix fully supported - The write function call was causing problems
  with certain linkers (SunOS and Ultrix), leading to Segementation faults.
- Compiler definitions included for new defines that may not be
  supported by systems without complete ANSI header files.
- 16 bit Windows version released.

24.11.1996 - Microsoft OS supported (0.10) (Internal)
-----------------------------------------------------
- Full native support for Microsoft Operating Systems, including MS-DOS,
Windows 3.x, Windows 95, and Windows NT. There is only a command line, but
it runs natively.
- Source file names and database relations have been reduced to cater for
shorter DOS names without renaming hassles.

26.10.1996 - 0.9 Released (0.9)
-------------------------------

26.10.1996 - Support Environment improvements (0.8.9)
-----------------------------------------------------
- Commands can now be entered that span over one entire line. Terminate
the commands with a semi-colon (;) - Set "long" on, or specify the -o
command line switch.
- Shell command. Specify operating system commands by preceeding the command
with an exclamation mark.
- Timing information implemented.
- Variables implemented.
- Rename operator implemented.

23.10.1996 - Create relation operator implemented (0.8.8)
---------------------------------------------------------
Implementation of a "create relation" operator. Users can now create their
own relations, and add data to it...

22.10.1996 - Fine tuning (0.8.7)
--------------------------------
Fine tuned some issues and removed duplicate join operator (there
*was* a natural join and theta-join version. Only the one now.

16.10.1996 - Majority of memory leaks plugged (0.8.6)
-----------------------------------------------------
Following a run of Purify against LEAP, the majority of memory
leaks that existed have been removed. Purify instruments the
program and displays where memory is allocated, for memory that
is never freed. In addition, file handles that were not closed
were also closed. Unfortunately, Purify is a commercial product,
but luckily available to me at work. Fortunately, it is a brilliant program,
and saved much headache.

14.10.1996 - Natural Join implemented (0.8.5)
---------------------------------------------
First implementation of the Natural Join. This includes a lot of
new functionality to define primary and foreign keys, although
there is NO enforcement of it.

13.10.1996 - Duplicate & insert operator implemented (0.8.4)
------------------------------------------------------------
Duplicate operator now implemented to allow immediate duplication of
relations. Insert allows data to be added by user to relation. This
sets "dirty" flag and loads hash table.

16.09.1996 - Regression scripts better (0.8.3)
----------------------------------------------
Regression scripts are now more comprehensive. Still some way to
go before they are really finished, but they are much better than
before.

15.09.1996 - Automatic script exec. (0.8.2)
-------------------------------------------
Startup and open scripts are now executed by LEAP when system is
started, and a database opened. File comments (>) are echoed
to the screen.

15.09.1996 - Hashing Load disabled (0.8.1)
------------------------------------------
Hashing tables are not needed at the moment, so they are not loaded
into memory. New relations have them of course, and new permanent
relations have them saved. In due course, they will be loaded WHEN
they are needed, i.e. when insert/update has been implemented.

15.09.1996 - Attribute size (0.8.1)
-----------------------------------
Attributes now can optionally have a data length. This is currently
really of use only for display purposes, but in the long term, this
will be much more widely used.

15.09.1996 - Portability (0.8)
------------------------------
Implemented a number of important portability changes to the 
distribution, ie. autoconf is now used. LEAP should now be
compilable on a variety of different architectures. There
is still some tuning to be done(!!), but the framework is
there at last.

11.09.1996 - All Stanczyk scripts work (0.7.4)
----------------------------------------------
Modified all scripts to get rid of irratating DOS chars (Caused by
copying from DOS partition), and removed old obsoleted operators.
Minor changes to use command to list available databases, and
implemented database information.

At this stage, LEAP is almost at 0.9 status. (See ideas.bin),
but memory leaks need to be identified, and functional gaps
and TODO's plugged. 

11.09.1996 - Status settings implemented (0.7.3)
------------------------------------------------
Status settings are now enabled, and can be set and reviewed
from within LEAP.

11.09.1996 - Restructuring of includes and directories (0.7.3)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Restructured the directory structure to include a seperate
include directory. dtypes.h split into three components:
- dtypes.h    - Data types.
- constants.h - Global constants/defs
- globals.h   - Global variables.

10.09.1996 - Help functionality added (0.7.2)
---------------------------------------------
Implemented help page viewing. System is far more efficent
and flexible than the old DOS version.

08.09.1996 - Minor distribution restructuring (0.7.1)
-----------------------------------------------------
Modified the structure of the distribution to fit in with LSM
recommendation. Created LSM entry, which will be posted up
09.09.1996.

08.09.1996 - Source code review operations added (0.7.1)
--------------------------------------------------------
Two functions for listing source files and displaying a source
file has been added, with minor changes necessary elsewhere to
accomodate this.

05.09.1996 - Regression test scripts started. (0.7.1)
-----------------------------------------------------
A basic start to the regression tests have been made, which should check
basic operations, and provide a basis for other developers to use when
making changes. These scripts can then be run to make sure that the changes
do not impact on the existing functionality.

05.09.1996 - Compilation on Ultrix, SunOS and NeXt (0.7.0)
----------------------------------------------------------
Whilst working on critical PN support at work, played around with compilation
issues. SunOS now works beautifully, even better than Solaris in fact. NeXt
complains about creating hash files, probablz down to POSIX issues. Ultrix
just cores on startup, but dbx available, so should be easy to pin point.

05.09.1996 - Usenet announcement (0.7.0) 
----------------------------------------
After the first posting failed dismally, because of the crummy news server
in AMS domain, and the failed posting to demons mail2news, I used the 
Dejanews system, and the result was spectacular. In the space of about
5 hours, there were 50 or 60 hits on the LEAP home page.

03.09.1996 - First public release of the C source (0.7.0)
---------------------------------------------------------
The first release of the C source code was made today. The new revamped
home page contains links to the files. Announcements were made to the
LEAP mailing list and usenet.

03.09.1996 - Multiple Databases implemented (0.7.0)
---------------------------------------------------
The multiple database idea from 0.10 has now been implemented, with the
start of the basic data dictionary. Still to do is the expansion of this
functionality to use the remaining column from the leapdata table to 
determine the directory in which the data may be found. This could conceivably
lay the foundation for users own databases, and master databases.

01.09.1996 - Implemented the join operator and multiple tuple eval. (0.6.9)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first attempt at the join operator has been successful. This needed quite
an overhaul of some of the evaluation operations, and some tweaking elsewhere
to allow for compatibility with other routines (evaluation reusing the
same memory structure).

31.08.1996 - Implemented the Boolean data type (0.6.6)
------------------------------------------------------
Added a new data type. In doing this, some of the operators needed
tweaking, and also to fix one or two bugs. 

29.08.1996 - Implemented condition builder/evaluator/select. (0.6.5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In the process of the implementation of the select operator, implemented
a DYNAMIC query evaluator. Takes an expression, and builds a linked list
of conditions. Select operator supports multiple conditions. Should
be relatively straight forward to implement nested conditions.

11.05.1996 - Fixed minor bugs, stabalised parser, etc. (0.5.9 - 0.6)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Several bugs were fixed, mainly with the parser. In addition, the
parser now has some error messages of its own. Moved version to 0.6,
for the next main effort is implementation of the remaining 
relational operators.

09.05.1996 - Implemented Intersection (0.5.8 - 0.5.9)
-----------------------------------------------------
Which means that there are now three operators: project,
union and intersect. This is quite a good staging point
to implement the remaining operators. The only real difficulties
will be with the evaluation of expressions... Then the
tidying up can begin...

08.05.1996 - Fixed problem with parser (0.5.7 - 0.5.8)
------------------------------------------------------
Parser was overwriting a pointer, which led to all hell breaking
loose on the pointer front. Fixed, so the parser is now a fair
bit more stable, and can handle very large expressions... :)

07.05.1996 - Made the compilation fussy (0.5.6 - 0.5.7)
-------------------------------------------------------
The Makefile now contains -Wall and -W flags to make sure that
the fussiest possible compilation occurs.

05.05.1996 - Source files implemented (0.5.5 - 0.5.6)
-----------------------------------------------------
Source files are supported, and are executed very nicely and
in an integrated fashion.

05.05.1996 - Parse tree handles no bracketed commands (0.5 -> 0.5.5)
	   - Hashing structures always built, and saved/loaded.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For example "print p" works just as well as "print (p)". Hash
tables (now in ASCII Format) are created and stored each and every
time, and loaded/built as appropriate. They are saved for permanent
relations.

05.05.1996 - Various bugs fixed, and handles obsoleted functionality
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Title says it all really. Various "old" functions that are not
going to be implemented (eg. "infix y") are caught and handled.

04.05.1996 - Parse tree processing handles all commands (0.4 -> 0.5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Brand new to LEAP - The iterative parser now handles absolutely
everything that is input by the user. This ensures that there is
one place that all the processing is done. A parse tree is
ALWAYS built, and commands are handled in a structured and
sensible manner. Logical parse tree processing now replaces the
mish-mash that was implemented before (From Pascal version). It's
still not perfect, but its a big change, enough to warrant a 
small step. Now the implementation can proceed in a straight
forward manner. I'd almost say that now all the hard work has
been done... Its "just" a matter of finishing off functionality
and tidying up stuff.

02.05.1996 - Implemented parse tree processing (0.3 -> 0.4)
-----------------------------------------------------------
A parse tree is now built, and processed. Some bugs in the
hashing oeprations have also been removed.

01.05.1996 - Implemented iterative parser
-----------------------------------------
A parse tree is now built iteratively. Processing is still a
"todo", but expressions can now be understood in full.

25.04.1996 - First relational operator implemented
--------------------------------------------------
The project operator has now been implemented in full (well,
sort of!). It does what its supposed to, and utilises the
hashing functionality in order to remove duplicates. Its still
in need of some specific modifications and improvements, but
its functionally there.

20.04.1996 - Hashing implemented
--------------------------------
Hashing has been implemented, but not tested yet. Just a straight
copy from the Pascal source, and correcting compile time errors.
No doubt there will be a fair few problems!

19.04.1996 - Source entered to RCS control
------------------------------------------
Source code etc. added to the RCS development control system.
Under experiment for now. Should be similair to SCCS if the
instructions are to be believed!

15.04.1996 - Tuples implemented (0.2 -> 0.3)
--------------------------------------------
Tuples are now basically implemented. A relation can now
be opened, and the data extracted from it in a sequential
manner. This now leaves the way open to process relations
in a structured and orderly manner. Next step is the relational
operators and an interface to the various commands. Not
forgetting the important house keeping!

14.04.1996 - TODO's
-------------------
As implementation proceeds, TODO's are being added to the
various files to indicate areas where work is still needed.
There are two types of TODO's - Normal TODO's are necessary
and needed, in order to make LEAP have the same functionality.
Then there are IDEA TODO's, which are for improvements to
the code. A simple grep on the .c and .h files should show all
source files needing work.

14.04.1996 - Attributes implemented (0.1 -> 0.2)
------------------------------------------------
Well, after a bit of effort (most of the time caught up
in a confusion over call by reference/value in C, and FILE
descriptors...), the attributes (NOT fields! I'm making the
change here at the source code level), are implemented
as far as is necessary for this initial effort.


14.04.1996 - File started (0.01 -> 0.1)
---------------------------------------
At this stage, the implementation is still very minimal, the
relation structures are maintained in the database, and inserts
are possible (directly taken from Pascal code).

Error handling is implemented, and the file is read CORRECTLY
and errors reported. Taking the Pascal version to avoid changing
error numbers. New errors start at 39.

The makefile works fine - It checks files as it should do, which
is a great achievement (not having understood makefiles as I 
really needed to!). 

Now that relations are implemented, its time to move on. Destruction
of objects is a necessity, but not at this stage, "housekeeping"
can wait until its looking a bit more complete. As the Pascal code
is there, I can come back and address the issues with 99% accuracy.
