These scripts are included to make LEAP easier to use in a large user environment.

SETTING UP THE BASE INSTALLATION
================================
In order to make the installation process as simple as possible, first 
make sure you can compile and run LEAP in your environment. You may modify 
the help pages, or included databases as much as you like. Set the 
configurations as you feel appropriate.

Once you are satisfied with your installation, copy it to a location that ALL 
users can access. On a Solaris installation, for example, this might be 
/opt/LEAP.  Request that the Systems Administrator (SA) gives you alone 
write permission. Students/Users should NOT have write permission to 
this directory (755).

Now COPY all of the LEAP installation across to this directory, with:

cp -r LEAP_source_directory LEAP_target_directory

Check the directory contains something like the following with "ls -l":

Now run LEAP_source_directory/scripts/users/buildtar

You will be prompted to enter the base directory (eg. /opt/leap). You will also
be prompted to enter the target directory for LEAP's central build. By default
this is the directory you just specified with /build appended.

Completing this will create a tar file that contains a copy of changeable 
files (database, configs, and reports). Symbolic links are set up for all 
other directories.

The tar file is stored in the target directory. Check it with 
"tar tvf leap_build.tar" to list the contents.

If some users are likely to want to take LEAP to their own Unix machines
(such as Linux box at home), several options present themselves:

- Create a tar file of the build directory which can be transferred at 
  will. 
- Place the file on a central NFS server from which the LEAP install
  directory can be mounted by all clients (obviously not practical for
  home access!).
- Suggest users compile LEAP for themselves (See below).

Remember to make sure users are aware of machine compatibility issues.

If you feel that some users may wish to compile LEAP for themselves, a
suggestion would be to place the original LEAP distribution file in
the target directory. This will save repeated downloads from ftp servers.
Instructions for advanced users are included at the end of this file on
the assumption this is where the file has been placed.

NB. You may want to edit the user script 'leapinstall' to simplify the
user installation procedure.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USERS
======================
The following instructions can be passed out to users of LEAP in order to get a
copy of LEAP installed with minimal problems. Change the $LEAPINSTALLDIR to 
the directory in which LEAP was installed (!).

In order to install LEAP, run the script:

$LEAPINSTALLDIR/scripts/users/leapinstall

You will be asked to enter the LEAP source directory. This is $LEAPINSTALLDIR.

A target directory is then required. This should be in your home ($HOME) 
directory. It defaults to the directory in which the script is being run. 
Specify $HOME/leap in order that the LEAP installation is in its own 
directory.

LEAP will then proceed to extract all necessary files from the archive, and 
create links to files that can be shared.

If you're reinstalling LEAP, then you will be prompted to remove or overwrite
the existing installation.

eg. Sample installation script (with installation dir /opt/leap):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bash$ /opt/leap/scripts/users/leapinstall 
Enter the LEAP installation source directory:
/opt/leap/build
Enter leap target directory [/home/rleyton/leap]
/home/rleyton/leap
Completed.
bash$ cd /home/rleyton/leap
bash$ ls -l

In order to run LEAP, change directories to the LEAP target directory you
specified at the second prompt (eg. /home/rleyton/leap), and type:

bin/leap

ADVANCED USERS
==============
Advanced users may want to compile and run LEAP for themselves, with any
changes they wish to make. The easiest solution is to check to see if the
original distribution is present in the LEAP Installation directory
(eg. /opt/leap/build) - Copy the file to your directory, uncompress and
extract the file, and read the file INSTALL.

If the file is not present, consult your lecturer, especially if you do
no have access to the Internet, or if you do not have a particularly
fast link.
